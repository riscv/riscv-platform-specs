# RISC-V Profiles and Platform Specification

The files in this project are used to create the RISC-V Profiles and
Platform Specification.  This specification defines the set of firmware
and hardware required of a RISC-V platform so that it may install
and run various operating systems.

The content of the specification is created and controlled by the RISC-V
Profiles and Platform Specification Technical Subcommittee.  Information
about the subcommittee can be found at
https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-unixplatformspec.
Please note that membership in RISC-V International is required to post
to the mailing list, but it is publicly readable.  Membership in RISC-V
International is free for individual community members.

All discussion of this specification occurs on the task group mailing
list.  Please use github issues for bug reports.
