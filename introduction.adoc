# Introduction

This document is the RISC-V Profiles and Platform Specification (RVP2S).

This specification defines the hardware and firmware required to be able
to install and use one or more operating environments (OEs) on a computing
system built around the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).  The
intent is to capture the constraints necessary for hardware so that an
operating environment can be assured it is compatible with that hardware,
if it is in compliance with the specification.

For the purposes of this specification an _operating environment_ can
range from a single application running on a bare metal system to a full
scale server operating system (OS) running a Linux distribution on a
commercial off-the shelf (COTS) system.

Constraints on the hardware and firmware comprising part of a platform
are key to this specification.  However, these constraints are only meant
to define a baseline set of functionality.  Vendors may add whatever
advanced functionality they wish beyond that, as long as it is discoverable
in some way.  For example, any given platform may need an MMU or an IRQ
controller to boot, but may not require an I2C bus; the vendor can of course
add that bus if they wish, but it might not be part of the required baseline
for that platform.

This specification also sets out any necessary constraints on the RISC-V
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) -- at all privilege levels -- that are
required to provide a consistent and predictable environment for running
operating systems.

The intent is to provide only the constraints necessary, and not to restrict
creativity.

The structure of the document is straightforward.  First, basic terminology
is defined, in particular the terms _profile_ and _platform_ that form the
basis for the structure of the rest of the specification.  Second, the
currently defined profiles are described, setting out the use of the RISC-V
architecture in a processor.  Third, the current defined platforms are
described with specific hardware, firmware, and software requirements.
And finally, checklists are provided in the appendices to make it easier
to determine if a new system meets a given platform specification.
