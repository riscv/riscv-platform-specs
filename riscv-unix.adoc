## Introduction

This document contains the RISC-V Unix-class Platform Specification, which
allows for software binary compatibility between various RISC-V
implementations.  This specification defines no new instructions, but does
restrict the RISC-V User ISA Specification and RISC-V Privileged ISA
specification by mandating the existence of some instructions and additional
memory orderings.  The bulk of this specification mandates the behavior that
complaint implementations must exhibit WRT to supervisor-mode software, with an
explicit attempt to avoid mandating any behavior when in machine-mode.

The RISC-V Unix-class Platform Specification is an open standard.

## Restrictions on the RISC-V User and Supervisor ISA Specifications

### Additional Memory Ordering Requirements

Within main-memory regions, aligned instruction fetch must be atomic, up to
the smaller of ILEN and XLEN bits.  In particular, if an aligned 4-byte word
is stored with the `sw` instruction, then any processor attempts to execute
that word, the processor either fetches the newly stored word, or some
previous value stored to that location.  (That is, the fetched instruction is
not an unpredictable value, nor is it a hybrid of the bytes of the old and new
values.)

Unless otherwise specified by a given I/O device, I/O regions are at least
point-to-point strongly ordered.  All devices attached to a given PCIe root
complex are on the same ordered channel (numbered 2 or above), though different
root complexes might not be on the same ordering channel.

External devices (DMA engines, the debug unit, non RISC-V cores, etc) that are
visible to RISC-V harts must appear as coherent agents, just like any RISC-V
hart would.  If additional ordering constraints are necessary for a device to
function, those will be provide by a device-specific mechanism.

### Restrictions on Valid Instructions

RISC-V Unix-class systems implement any of the RV32IMAC, RV32Gc, RV64IMAC, or
RV64GC ISAs with supervisor mode.  RV64I-based systems implement the Sv39
page-based virtual-memory scheme, and RV32I-based systems implement the Sv32
page-based virtual memory scheme.  Systems may support additional ISA
extensions, but if these extensions add user-visible architectural state, they
must be initially disabled.  Systems that support Sv48 must support Sv39,
systems that support Sv57 must support Sv48, and so forth.

On RV64I-based Unix-class systems the negative virtual addresses are reserved
for the kernel.
